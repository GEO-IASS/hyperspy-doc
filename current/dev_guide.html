<p>This 6-step guide is intended to give people who want to start contributing their
own tools to HyperSpy a foothold to kick-start the process. This is also the way
to start if you ultimately hope to become a member of the developer team.</p>
<p>We anticipate that many potential contributors and developers will be scientists
who may have a lot to offer in terms of expert knowledge but may have little
experience when it comes to working on a reasonably large open-source project
like HyperSpy. This guide is aimed at you - helping to reduce the barrier to make
a contribution.</p>
<p>Before you start you should decide which platform (i.e. Linux, Windows, or Mac)
you are going to work in. All are possible and the advice below is the same it&#8217;s
only the specifics that change.</p>
<div class="section" id="start-using-hyperspy-and-understand-it">
<h2>1. Start using HyperSpy and understand it<a class="headerlink" href="#start-using-hyperspy-and-understand-it" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The best way to start understanding how HyperSpy works and to build a broad
overview of the code as it stands is to use it &#8211; so what are you waiting for?</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://hyperspy.org/download.html">Download HyperSpy</a></p>
<p>The user-guide also provides a good overview of all the parts of the code that
are currently implemented as well as much information about how everything works
&#8211; so read it well.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="www.hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/current/index.html">HyerSpy User-Guide</a></p>
<p>For developing the code the home of hyperspy is on github and you&#8217;ll see that
a lot of this guide boils down to using that platform well. so visit the link
below and poke around the code, issues, and pull requests.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy">HyperSpy on Github</a></p>
<p>it&#8217;s probably also worth visiting the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/">Github</a> home page
and going through the &#8220;boot camp&#8221; to get a feel for the terminology.</p>
<p>In brief, to give you a hint on the terminology to search for, the contribution
pattern is:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Setup git/github if you don&#8217;t have it.</li>
<li>Fork HyperSpy on github.</li>
<li>Checkout your fork on your local machine.</li>
<li>Create a new branch locally where you will make your changes.</li>
<li>Push the local changes to your own github fork.</li>
<li>Create a pull request to the official HyperSpy repository.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Note: You cannot mess up the main HyperSpy project unless you have been promoted
to write access and the dev-team. So when you&#8217;re starting out be confident to
play, get it wrong, and if it all goes wrong you can always get a fresh install
of HyperSpy!!</p>
<p>PS: If you choose to develop in Windows/Mac you may find <cite>Github Desktop &lt;https://desktop.github.com&gt;</cite> useful.</p>

<div class="section" id="got-a-problem-ask">
<h2>2. Got a problem? &#8211; ask!<a class="headerlink" href="#got-a-problem-ask" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Open source projects are all about community - we put in much effort to make
good tools available to all and most people are happy to help others start out.
Everyone had to start at some point and the philosophy of these projects
centres around the fact that we can do better by working together.</p>
<p>Much of the conversation happens in &#8216;public&#8217; via online platforms. The main two
forums used by HyperSpy developers are:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://gitter.im/hyperspy/hyperspy">Gitter</a> &#8211; where we host a live chat-room in which people can ask questions and
discuss things in a relatively informal way.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues">Github</a> &#8211; the main repository for the source code also enables issues to be
raised in a way that means they&#8217;re logged until dealt with. This is also a
good place to make a proposal for some new feature or tool that you want to
work on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pick-your-battles">
<h2>3. Pick your battles<a class="headerlink" href="#pick-your-battles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Work out what you want to contribute and break it down in to managable chunks.</p>
<p>You may have a very clear idea of what you want to contribute but if you&#8217;re
not sure where to start you can always look through the issues and pull requests
on the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/">GitHub Page</a>. You&#8217;ll find that
there are many known areas for development in the issues and a number of
pull-requests are part finished projects just sitting there waiting for a keen
new contributor to come and learn by finishing.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;ve decided what you&#8217;re going to work on - let people know using the
online forums!</p>
<p>It may be that someone else is doing something similar and can help, it&#8217;s also
good to make sure that those working on related projects are pulling in the
same direction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="get-good-habits">
<h2>4. Get good habits<a class="headerlink" href="#get-good-habits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are 3 key points to get right when starting out as a contributor - keep
work separated in managable sections, make sure that your code style is good,
and bear in mind that every new function you write will need a test and user
documentation!</p>
<div class="section" id="use-git-and-work-in-managable-branches">
<h3>Use git and work in managable branches<a class="headerlink" href="#use-git-and-work-in-managable-branches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>By now you&#8217;ll have had a look around GitHub - but why&#8217;s it so important?</p>
<p>Well GitHub is the public forum in which we manage and discuss development of
the code. More importantly, it enables every developer to utilise Git which is
an open source &#8220;version control&#8221; system that you can use on your laptop or
desktop. By version control we mean that you can separate out your contribution
to the code into many versions (called branches) and switch between them easily.
Later you can choose which version you want to have integrated into HyperSpy.</p>
<p>You can learn all about Git <a class="reference external" href="www.git-scm.com/about">here</a>!</p>
<p>The most important thing for you to do is to separate your contributions so that
each branch is small advancement on the &#8220;master&#8221; code or on another branch. In
the end each branch will have to be checked and reviewed by someone else before
it can be included - so if it&#8217;s too big, you will be asked to split it up!</p>
<p>For personal use, before integrating things into the main HyperSpy code, you may
want to use a few branches together. You can do that but just make sure each new
thing has it&#8217;s own branch! You can merge some together for your personal use.</p>
<p>Diagramatically you should be aiming for something like this:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/branching_schematic.eps" src="_images/branching_schematic.eps" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="get-the-style-right">
<h3>Get the style right<a class="headerlink" href="#get-the-style-right" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>HyperSpy follows the Style Guide for Python Code - these are just some rules for
consistency that you can read all about in the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">Python Style Guide</a>.</p>
<p>You can check your code with the <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8">pep8 Code Checker</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="write-tests-documentation">
<h3>Write tests &amp; documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#write-tests-documentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Every new function that is writen in to HyperSpy needs to be tested and documented.</p>
<p>Tests &#8211; these are short functions found in hyperspy/tests that call your functions
under some known conditions and check the outputs against known values. They should
depend on as few other features as possible so that when they break we know exactly
what caused it. Writing tests can seem laborious but you&#8217;ll probaby soon find that
they&#8217;re very important as they force you to sanity check all you do. When comparing
integers, it&#8217;s fine to use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">==</span></code>. When comparing floats, be sure to use
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">assert_almost_equal()</span></code>.</p>
<p>Documentation comes in two parts docstrings and user-guide documentation.</p>
<p>Docstrings &#8211; written at the start of a function and give essential information
about how it should be used, such as which arguments can be passed to it and what
the syntax should be.</p>
<p>User-guide Documentation &#8211; A description of the functionality of the code and how
to use it with examples and links to the relevant code.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="make-your-contribution">
<h2>5. Make your contribution<a class="headerlink" href="#make-your-contribution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you&#8217;ve got a branch that&#8217;s ready to be incorporated in to the main code of
HyperSpy &#8211; make a pull request on GitHub and wait for it to be reviewed and
discussed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="contributing-cython-code">
<h2>6. Contributing cython code<a class="headerlink" href="#contributing-cython-code" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Python is not the fastest language, and can be particularly slow in loops.
Performance can sometimes be significantly improved by implementing optional cython
code alongside the pure Python versions. While developing cython code, make use of
the official cython recommendations (<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.cython.org/">http://docs.cython.org/</a>).
Add your cython extensions to the setup.py, in the existing list of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">raw_extensions</span></code>.</p>
<p>Unlike the cython recommendation, the cythonized .c or .cpp files are not welcome
in the git source repository (except original c or c++ files), since they are typically
quite large. Cythonization will take place during Travis CI and Appveyor building.
The cythonized code will be generated and included in source or binary distributions
for end users. To help troubleshoot potential deprecation with future cython releases,
add a comment with in the header of your .pyx files with the cython version.
If cython is present in the build environment and any cythonized c/c++ file is missing,
then setup.py tries to cythonize all extensions automatically.</p>
<p>To make the development easier the new command <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">recythonize</span></code> has been added to setup.py.
It can be used in conjunction with other default commands.
For example <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">setup.py</span> <span class="pre">recythonize</span> <span class="pre">build_ext</span> <span class="pre">--inplace</span></code>
will recythonize all changed (and described in setup.py!) cython code and compile.</p>
<p>When developing on git branches, the first time you call setup.py in conjunction with
or without any other command - it will generate a post-checkout hook, which will include
a potential cythonization and compilation product list (.c/.cpp/.so/.pyd). With your next
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">checkout</span></code> the hook will remove them and automatically run <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">setup.py</span> <span class="pre">build_ext</span> <span class="pre">--inplace</span></code>
to cythonize and compile the code if available. If an older version of HyperSpy (&lt;= 0.8.4.x)
is checked out this should have no side effects.</p>
<p>If another custom post-checkout hook is detected on PR, then setup.py tries to append
or update the relevant part. To prevent unwanted hook generation or update you can create
the empty file <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.hook_ignore</span></code> in source directory (same level as setup.py).</p>
