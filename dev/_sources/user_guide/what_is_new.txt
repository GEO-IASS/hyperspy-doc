What's new in Hyperspy
======================

Version 0.4
-----------

Version 0.3
-----------

Of course, the most noticeable change is that we have changed the name of the project from EELSLab to Hyperspy. We have also rewritten the core of the code and added many new features. Therefore, if you are coming from EELSLab we advice you to read the documentation throughly because, although many things will be familiar, there has been some changes in the syntax and terminology.
