Data visualisation
******************

The object returned by :py:func:`~.io.load` is a :py:class:`~.signal.Signal`
and has a :py:meth:`~.signal.Signal.plot` method which plots the data and
allows navigation.

.. code-block:: python
    
    >>> s = load('YourDataFilenameHere')
    >>> s.plot()

if the object is single spectrum or an image one window will appear when
calling the plot method.

If the object is a 1D or 2D spectrum-image (i.e. with 2 or 3 dimensions when
including energy) two figures will appear, one containing a plot of the
spectrum at the current coordinates and the other an image of the data summed
over its spectral dimension if 2D or an image with the spectral dimension in
the x-axis if 1D:

.. _2d_SI:

.. figure::  images/2D_SI.png
   :align:   center
   :width:   500

   Visualisation of a 2D spectrum image
   
.. _1d_SI:

.. figure::  images/1D_SI.png
   :align:   center
   :width:   500

   Visualisation of a 1D spectrum image
   
Equivalently, if the object is a 1D or 2D image stack two figures will appear, 
one containing a plot of the image at the current coordinates and the other
a spectrum or an image obtained by summing over the image dimensions:
   
.. _1D_image_stack.png:

.. figure::  images/1D_image_stack.png
   :align:   center
   :width:   500    

   Visualisation of a 1D image stack
   
.. _2D_image_stack.png:

.. figure::  images/2D_image_stack.png
   :align:   center
   :width:   500
   
   Visualisation of a 2D image stack

To change the current coordinates, click on the pointer (which will be a line
or a square depending on the dimensions of the data) and drag it around. It is
also possible to move the pointer by using the numpad arrows **when numlock is
on and the spectrum or navigator figure is selected**.When using the numpad
arrows the PageUp and PageDown keys change the size of the step.

An extra cursor can be added by pressing the ``e`` key. Pressing ``e`` once
more will disable the extra cursor:

.. _second_pointer.png:

.. figure::  images/second_pointer.png
   :align:   center
   :width:   500

   Visualisation of a 2D spectrum image using two pointers.

When exploring a 2D hyperspectral object of high spatial resolution the default
size of the rectangular cursors can be too small to be dragged or even seen. It
is possible to change the size of the cursors by pressing the ``+`` and ``-``
keys  **when the navigator window is selected**.

The same keys can be used to explore an image stack.



=========   =============================
key         function    
=========   =============================
e           Switch second pointer on/off
Arrows      Change coordinates  
PageUp      Increase step size
PageDown    Decrease step size
``+``           Increase pointer size
``-``           Decrease pointer size
``h``       Launch the contrast adjustment tool (only for Image)
=========   =============================

To close all the figures run the following command:

.. code-block:: python

    close('all')

.. NOTE::

    This is a `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_ command.
    Matplotlib is the library that hyperspy uses to produce the plots. You can
    learn how to pan/zoom and more  `in the matplotlib documentation
    <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/navigation_toolbar.html>`_

Visualisation of multi-dimensional data
****************************************

With the aim to ease the data analysis of multidimensionnal data, Hyperspy
provides a powerful and flexible :py:meth:`~.signal.Signal.plot` method to
visualize n-dimensional data. In this chapter, the visualisation of data of 3
or more dimensions is exemplified with a image stack and a 4D hyperspectrum
obtained by recording two signals in parallele in a FIB/SEM: the intensity of
the secondary electron emission (SE image) and the X-ray spectrum (EDS map).

The plot() function
-------------------

The visualisation with :py:meth:`~.signal.Signal.plot` of 1D and 2D signal is
given in :ref:`getting started <getting-help-label>`. Further options are shown
here.

Stack of images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Stack of 2D images can be imported as an 3D image and plotted with a slider.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> img = load('image*.tif', stack=True)
    >>> img.plot(navigator=None)
    
    
.. figure::  images/3D_image.png
   :align:   center
   :width:   500    

   Visualisation of a 3D image with a slider.   
   
Spectrum images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A stack of 2D spectrum images can be imported as a 3D spectrum image and
plotted with sliders.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> spec = load('spectrum_image*.tif', stack=True)
    >>> spec.plot()
    
    
.. figure::  images/3D_spectrum.png
   :align:   center
   :width:   650    

   Visualisation of a 3D spectrum image with sliders.
   
If the 3D images has the same spatial dimension as the 3D spectrum image, it
can be used as an external signal for the navigator.
   
   
.. code-block:: python

    >>> spec.plot(navigator=img)    
    
.. figure::  images/3D_spectrum_external.png
   :align:   center
   :width:   650    

   Visualisation of a 3D spectrum image. The navigator is an external signal.
   
Stack of spectral images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The 3D spectrum image can be transformed in a stack of spectral images for an
alternative display.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> imgSpec = spec.to_image((0, 1))
    >>> imgSpec.plot(navigator='spectrum')
    
    
.. figure::  images/3D_image_spectrum.png
   :align:   center
   :width:   650    

   Visualisation of a stack of 2D spectral images.
   
An external signal (e.g. a spectrum) can be used as a navigator, for example
the "maximum spectrum" for which each channel is the maximum of all pixels. 

.. code-block:: python

    >>> specMax = spec.max(0).max(0).max(0)
    >>> imgSpec.plot(navigator=specMax)
    
    
.. figure::  images/3D_image_spectrum_external.png
   :align:   center
   :width:   650    

   Visualisation of a stack of 2D spectral images. 
   The navigator is the "maximum spectrum".

Using Mayavi to visualize 3D data
---------------------------------

Although Hyperspy does not currently support plotting when signal_dimension is
greater than 2, `Mayavi <http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/>`_ can be
used for this purpose.

In the following example we also use `scikit-image <http://scikit-image.org/>`_
for noise reduction: 

.. code-block:: python

    >>> #Import packages
    >>> from skimage import filter
    >>> from mayavi import mlab
    >>> #Generate the X-ray intensity map of Nickel L alpha
    >>> NiMap = specImg3Dc.get_intensity_map(['Ni_La'])[0]
    >>> #Reduce the noise
    >>> NiMapDenoise = filter.tv_denoise(NiMap.data)
    >>> #Plot isosurfaces
    >>> mlab.contour3d(NiMapDenoise)
    >>> mlab.outline()
        
    
.. figure::  images/mayavi.png
   :align:   center
   :width:   450    

   Visualisation of isosurfaces with mayavi.
